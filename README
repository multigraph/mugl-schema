This project contains the master copy of the XSD schema file that
defines the specification for MUGL files; the file is "mugl.xsd".

This file is maintained in its own project so that other projects that
need to use the XSD file can reference this project, and there is just
one master copy of the file to maintain.

The project github.com:multigraph/java-multigraph contains several
test mugl files and a build script for automatically validating them.

In addition to the "master" branch, this project has an "experimental"
branch which contains a copy of the schema file for an older, incomplete
Java version of Multigraph (project github.com:multigraph/java-multigraph).
